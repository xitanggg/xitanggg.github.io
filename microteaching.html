							<h3>Microteaching</h3>
							<p class="biao-ti">Me via Microteaching</p>
							<p>
								While being a grad student, I help TA a class. Cornell Engineering requires
								all new grad student TAs to complete <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/graduate-students/phd-students/academic-support-and-teaching-development/ta-development-0">Microteaching as part of the TA training program</a>.
								In Microteaching, each TA teaches a 5 minute micro-lesson on any topic to a
								micro-class of 4-5 TAs. Later, as a group, they will review a videotape of
								each of their teaching, see and reflect on teaching approaches, and get feedback from peers.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Thanks to procrastination, I started preparing my microteaching session an hour before
								I presented. I gave a 5 minute session on Chinese New Year. Afterwards, when looking back
								at the recorded videotape and reflecting upon myself, I am amazed to see how much it revealed
								about me, things that are just me and things I need to improve on.</p>
								<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:39.347%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5wS9jIN4T0" style="position:absolute;width:70%;height:100%;left:0" width="641" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

							<br/>
							<p class="biao-ti">The videotape reveals a few things about me:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I am a naturally happy person (mainly because I am truly grateful for life and everything I have),
									so I am “high” most of the time if not all the time. </li>
								<li>I like to compliment people and provide positive encouragement, saying things like “awesome”,
									“smart” naturally without realizing. I might pick up this habit subconsciously from training
									people in street workout. It is what I usually do to enhance confidence in people and push them
									to stretch further. </li>
								<li>I like to tell and explain things with examples, analogies, and stories, because that is how I
									learn best and things often become more concrete and relatable that way.</li>
								<li>I act funny sometimes. One reason for this is that I find happy and funny people approachable
									and I hope to create an approachable presence to others. Another reason is that I like having
									and creating a fun and comfortable environment. I think this type of environment connects people in a more personal
									level and encourages them to be more open to share their actual thoughts.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="biao-ti">Things I need to improve on:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I “um” a lot, like a lot in the video. I don’t normally “um” that much, maybe because I haven’t gotten a chance to practice. </li>
								<li>I verbalized some of my thoughts, but could have done better. I realized my thoughts go way
									faster than I could verbalize them. Some concepts that I explained in my head several times but
									 I never get to say it out. I need to be more conscious of the things I actually say out loud
									 vs things I say in my head. (Likewise, I say things faster than I could write them, so I didn't write and spell
 								  out some of the words on board. Teaching really takes practice.)</li>
								<li>My gesture is wild, going all over the place. I felt ok to let my body wander freely, maybe I should constraint myself sometimes.</li>
								<li>My pace of speaking is fast sometimes, so am I a fast paced person. I could be more clear and slow down a bit sometimes to avoid trading quality with speed.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<p class="typewrite">
								<a class="typewrite" data-period="2000" data-type='
								[
								"There is always a better way to do things.",
								"I feel mad excited to accelerate our world toward a happier tomorrow.",
								"Accessible empowerment is the future.",
								"I am truly grateful for everything I have.",
								"Let us move faster.",
								"I live in the field of product innovation, design, development and deployment." ]'>
