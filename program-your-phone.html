							<h3>"Program Your Phone" App</h3>
							<p class="biao-ti">Background</p>
							<p>In summer 2017, I was working at <a href="https://www.robowunderkind.com/">Robo Wunderkind</a> thanks to the generous support of the
								<a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/entrepreneurial-options-undergrad-students/kessler-fellows-program">Cornell Kessler Fellows Program</a>.
								Robo Wunderkind is
								an awesome EdTech startup that embeds electronics into modular blocks so kids or anyone can simply
								snap together blocks and program in an intuitive app to create many things. Inspired by Robo Wunderkind’s
								vision to make engineering accessible across age and background, I thought of the fact that our phone is
								a good piece of hardware with plenty of hardware functionalities. Together with my friend
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuteng-mei-753287127">Yuteng</a>,
								in winter 2018, we started building an app “Program Your Phone” that allows kids or teens or anyone to
								program their phones to do a lot of things by leaverging phone’s built-in hardware functionalities.
								Examples of things people can built with the app are intruder alarm, metal detector, image slideshow, home monitor...</p>
							<br/>
							<p>We made the below video to compete for the 2018 Lightspeed Summer Fellowship. The video compares using
								the Program Your Phone App vs using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino (a widely used electronic prototyping platform)</a>
								to build
								various things to show the intuitiveness and easiness of the App. For example, to make a blinking
								flashlight, the Arduino demands knowledge of hardware set up and C programming while the App only
								requires dragging and dropping five icons.</p>
							<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.21%"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k1uqzojcWoT_rHTg_4KJhCMnZfbt-4FN/preview" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" width="641" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

							<br/>
							<p class="biao-ti">Design and Development</p>
							<p>Yuteng and I spent roughly two weeks building the first version of the app. First, we brainstormed and
								layed out the design and framework of the app. We thought of a two panels design: a control panel and
								a programming panel. The control panel contains pre-built Actions and Triggers where users can simply
								drag and drop to the Programming Panel to create their inventions. For example, an user drags a
								“Flashlight On” Action from the Control Panel to State 1 - Action 1 of the Programming Panel. Once
								user clicks Start Button, the program will execute in order of states. In each state, it will perform
								all the actions of the given state. In State 1, there is a “Flashlight On” Action Icon, so starting
								this piece of code would turn on the flashlight of the mobile device.</p>

								<div class="row uniform">
									<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/program-your-phone/design1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/program-your-phone/design2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>Then we divided and conquered in building this app, Yuteng on the front end and I on the back end.
							Below, the left video shows Yuteng’s front end work of making the two panels and the drag drop functionality.
							The right video shows my back end work of extracting the hardware capability of a phone - flashlight, vibration,
							sound, image display, timer, accelerometer, distance sensor… Yuteng also built the data structure for
							actions/triggers and I also wrote the background thread that executes the actions/triggers program in order.
							Then we met up at the library and integrated the front end with the back end. </p>

								<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1evJUUBiQxzqB9LQKcjJ_fWoQkKkej5XY/preview" style="position:absolute;width:45%;height:90%;left:50%" width="641" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>Finally, I spent another day
							or two to design some icons using adobe illustrator and to finalize some colors after experimentation.
							And we made the first version of the app as shown at the top first video.</p>
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row uniform">
									<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/program-your-phone/icon.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p class="biao-ti">Result and Reflection</p>
							<p>We successfully created an up and running first version of the app with 4 actions (flashlight,
								vibration, music, image) and 4 triggers (countdown timer, accelerometer to detect shake, distance
								sensor to detect object in front, light sensor to detect light level). Still, there are many more
								actions (text screen, camera, phone call, message…) and triggers (microphone, gps, magnetometer,
								temperature, gyroscope, humility…) that we would need to work on. </p>
							<br/>
							<p>We didn’t make it to the 2018 Lightspeed Summer Fellowship. One of our weakness is that we never got
								a chance to test this with our users - kids and teens - to get their feedback on the design. And
								while our idea is exciting, it is more mission driven than financial driven, definitely not the
								most lucrative ones of the application pool. Regardless, I am still 100% in for the vision of our
								product, which is to make engineering accessible across age and background. As someone who wasn’t
								exposed to the magic world of engineering until sophomore year of college, I see countless similar
								myself out there that simply lacks the tool to experience the engineering field. And this App seeks
								to serve the need and bridge the gap. I will definitely continue working on this App, test with users, put it on App
								store and make it public one day.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>We also received the following advice from Lightspeed “What I can recommend is that if you are
								interested in entrepreneurship – and I mean truly committed to the career path – is that you read
								three things: 1) “Give and Take”, 2) Steve Blank’s book “The Startup Manual” and 3) “Do More, Faster”
								by Brad Feld.” On top of this, I would also suggest
								<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898">Eric Ries’s book “The Lean Startup”</a>,
								AMAZING book that provides the framework to create valuable product/service and the know-how to test hypothesis scientifically.</p>
