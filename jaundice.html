							<h3>Jaundice Therapy Device</h3>
							<p class="biao-ti">Background</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/jaundice/jaundice-cause.png" alt="" /></span>In 2016-2017 academic year, I was a member of <a href="https://ewh.engineering.cornell.edu/">Cornell Engineering World Health</a>,
								a project team with the mission to make innovative and low-cost medical devices for developing
								countries and low-resource communities. During our research and brainstorming phase, we found a
								lacked addressing medical problem - infantile jaundice, a condition where newborn baby’s skin
								and eyes are yellow due to immature liver not being able to process a build-up substance in the
								blood called bilirubin.
							</p>

							<br/>
							<p>Infantile jaundice has a simple phototherapy cure, which is shining blue light on the baby.
								Blue light can change bilirubin composition and allow it to exit baby’s body.
								<a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2011/09/21/peds.2011-1494.full.pdf">The American Academy of Pediatrics has set a clinical practice guideline in 2011</a>
								to standardize phototherapy treatment: 1) emission of light in the blue-to-green range (460 - 490 nm)
								and 2) irradiance of light at least 30 uW/cm^2/nm. Phototherapy following this guideline would
								demonstrate decrease of bilirubin concentrations during the first 4 to 6 hours of exposure.</p>

							<br/>
							<p>Despite the simplicity of cure, more than 6 millions jaundiced newborns still lack access to proper
								phototherapy treatment, risking potential brain damages or even death. We wanted to make jaundice
								phototherapy treatment more accessible and came up with a portable, sustainable, low-cost jaundice
								therapy device.</p>

							<br/>
							<p class="biao-ti">Design and Development</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jaundice/current-device.png" alt="" /></span>
							When researching, we found that there had been efforts into making jaundice phototherapy device.
							But these devices at the market were very costly and not easily transportable. Some even allow
							multiple babies in one device, which can lead to infection. </p>

							<br/><br/>
							<p>With this in mind, we brainstormed and sketched out our initial design among the team and
								then consulted with Dr. Srisatish Devapatla to finalize the design. Our design was a
								lightweight foldable device just like a laptop with a 180 degree roll top. Blue LEDs were
								embedded along the five strips on top and also the bottom. The bottom was made of waterproof
								fabric and bean bags to create a comfortable lying place. Next, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-danias-cornell">George</a> finalized the design dimension and CADed out the design.
									We then entered the building phase. </p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<p>We built the top five strips using a three step molding process.
								First, we cut out a wood mold using a jigsaw (which could be done much easier and more accurate via laser cutting).
								Second, we heated-gun PVC to make it bend and wrap along the mold. Third, we clamped the PVC and waited for
								it to cool down to stay in the desired shape. We then cut the mold smaller and repeat the molding process
								to create the other four strips. Attached are pictures of our small team working on molding:

							<p>While George was working on the hinge structure and Michael on the bottom bean bag base,
								in parallel, Nadine and I were working on battery research and testing with the LED strips to ensure they meet
								the AAP guideline. To make our device portable and sustainable, the device would have to be powered
								by rechargeable batteries. I looked up and tested out different batteries, e.g. alkaline, lead acid,
								lithium ion… All of them can power the device, but alkaline batteries are not rechargeable and fail
								to meet the sustainability spec. Lead acid batteries are rechargeable but very bulky and therefore
								fail the portability spec. Lithium ion batteries are rechargeable and light weighted due to its high
								energy density, so we went with lithium ion batteries and we found
								<a href="https://www.amazon.com/EBL-3000mAh-Rechargeable-Batteries-Universal/dp/B079RTBN4D/ref=sr_1_19_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1548197137&sr=8-19&keywords=EBL+lithium+batteries+and+charger">some small lithium ion batteries with 3A capacity.</a></p>

							<br/>
							<p>To meet the AAP guideline, our design has to meet two specifications: 1) emission of light in the
								blue-to-green range (460 - 490 nm) and 2) irradiance of light at least 30 uW/cm^2/nm. The first spec
								wavelength is met by our choice of LED and it can be verified in the
								<a href="http://www.ledlightsworld.com/datasheet/Specification-of-Flexible-LED-Strip-www.ledlightsworld.com.pdf">LED datasheet</a>
								that the wavelength
								of the blue LED is 465 - 470 nm, which is within the range. For the second spec irradiance,
								we measured the irradiance of our device using a
								<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Meter-Digital-Illuminance-Light-LX1010B/dp/B004K0A7I6/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1494297245&sr=8-5&keywords=light+meter">lux meter</a>
								and we measured 250-420 lux
								(intensity was highest at the center and lowest at the edge). 30 uW/cm^2/nm (at 555nm) = 204.9 lux
								<a href="https://www.translatorscafe.com/unit-converter/en/illumination/compact/">[conversion source]</a>
								or ~100 lux at 490 nm if we approximate the value based on the photopic luminosity function, so
								our device has irradiance level triple the 100 lux spec.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Once testing and verification were done, I CAD and 3D printed a black box to host the electronics.
								It was essentially a battery box that contained an on/off switch and connected three lithium ion batteries in series to bump up
								the nominal voltage to 3.7V * 3 = 11.7V. It then passed through a voltage regulator that dropped
								the voltage down to a steady 8.5V. (Battery voltage decreases as its capacity is using up.
								Lithium ion battery is 4.2V when fully charged and it should be recharged when voltage is down to
								3.2V to avoid damaging the battery. For three lithium ion batteries connected in series, this means a voltage swing from 12.6V
								to 9.6V. A voltage regulator eliminates such voltage swing and ensures constant voltage and brightness
								for LED strips, which we found 8.5V delivered the desired brightness and intensity.) </p>

									<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/jaundice/blackbox3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Lastly, once the mechanical was done, I worked on integrating the electrical with the mechanical and
								our jaundice therapy device was completed. The device had about 400 LEDs in total. At 8.5V, they are
								drawing 0.31A of current. The lithium ion battery we chose has capacity of 3AH. Given the fact that
								we should draw at most 80% of the battery capacity to avoid damaging the battery, our device could
								last 6-7 hours before the need to recharge the battery.</p>

							<p class="biao-ti">Result and Reflection</p>
							<p>In a two semester time frame, from concept, design to prototype, we successfully created an innovative
								jaundice therapy device that has three distinctive advantages:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Portable: The device is lightweight and 180 degree roll top foldable. It is also powered by battery,
									making it accessible to even the most rural place where there is no electricity.</li>
								<li>Sustainable: LED strips last 50,000 hours as opposed to halogen bulbs that last only 2,000 hours.
									Lithium ion batteries can be recharged more than 500 times. And the bottom lying layer of the device
									is waterproof, making it easy to clean and maintain.</li>
								<li>Low cost: The estimated cost to make our device is ~$80 while a current market device cost $400-$5000.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>Our project was also submitted to the 2017 Cornell Engineering Innovation Competition. During the final round,
								I was happy to pitch enthusiastically about our project in front of five judges. We were later awarded $5000 on
								the Yunni and Maxine Pao Social Innovation Award to further support the project team's mission to make accessible
								medical devices. In addition to the core engineering team’s effort,
								it is equally important to recognize the business team (
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theresacao">Theresa</a>,
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-davis-40101b134">Joanna</a>,
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-jha-870874b0">Rohit</a>
								) for making beautiful poster and drafting awesome business plan, the leadership team (
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antran2">Annie</a>,
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinselig">Justin</a>
								) for leading and signing up the project to various events and competitions, and two senior team member (
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarshjayakumar">Adarsh</a>,
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-durvasula-63515194">Samir</a>) for setting up and helping the project halfway.</p>

							<br/>
							<p>The natural next step was to test the device with hospital and user, and got their feedback to further improve the
								device. There were many improvements that can be made. However, as George was graduating and I was trapped with no
								spare time in three project based classes the following semester, the team decided to pause this project for now
								and allocated resources to pursue other projects that were more relevant to the new team’s skill sets. It was sad
								to make something that was never put into actual use, but we indeed proposed an innovative concept to address an unmet
								need and proved that it was doable to people who are interested in making jaundice therapy more accessible.</p>
